# EnsembleTechniques_Project_EasyVisa
The EasyVisa project utilizes ensemble techniques in Python to build a predictive model for visa application outcomes. This project focuses on streamlining the visa approval process by recommending whether to certify or deny an application based on applicant profiles. 
The project leverages various ensemble methods like Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking classifiers to achieve this goal.

* Skills & Tools Covered: 
EDA, Data Preprocessing, Customer Profiling, Bagging Classifiers (Bagging and Random Forest), Boosting Classifier (AdaBoost Gradient Boosting XGBoost)
Stacking Classifier, Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV, Business insights
